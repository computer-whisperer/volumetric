//! Boundary-representation solids as a sampleable payload: the data
//! contract between `step_import_operator` (which builds it) and
//! `brep_model_template` (which classifies points against it at sample
//! time).
//!
//! Like `trimesh_model_core`, the operator does all the work up front —
//! trim-loop projection, BVH construction, and serialization happen at
//! import time in [`payload::build_payload`] — and the generated model is
//! stateless: [`payload::PayloadView`] only reads. The IR ([`ir`]) and the
//! payload are internal to this crate and its two consumers; they are
//! deliberately NOT an ABI value type, so the surface vocabulary can grow
//! with importer coverage without touching the operator protocol.
//!
//! # Representation
//!
//! A [`ir::BRepModel`] is a set of solids — each a collection of trimmed
//! faces — plus placed instances (solid index + rigid transform + label).
//! Surfaces are exact analytic geometry (plane, cylinder, cone, sphere,
//! torus, extrusion of a polyline profile, NURBS); the only toleranced
//! data are the trim loops, which importers flatten into UV polylines.
//! Trim error is tangential along the exact surface, far below any
//! downstream meshing resolution.
//!
//! # Inside/outside semantics
//!
//! Occupancy is the union over instances. Per solid, classification is
//! crossing parity along a fixed skewed ray (the `trimesh_model_core`
//! approach), where a crossing is a ray–surface intersection whose UV
//! point lies inside the face's trim region (even-odd over the loops —
//! deliberately orientation-blind, so STEP sense flags never matter).
//! Kernels flag *suspect* casts — tangent hits, hits near a trim
//! boundary, near-pole/apex hits, unconverged Newton — and the query
//! re-casts along fallback directions before accepting a suspect parity.
//!
