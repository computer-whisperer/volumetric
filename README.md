# Volumetric

A high-performance volumetric modeling engine where models and operations are defined as portable WebAssembly (WASM) modules.

## Core Concept

The project explores a "model-as-code" paradigm where a 3D physical model is defined by a simple function: `is_inside(x: f64, y: f64, z: f64) -> f32` returning a density value. By leveraging WebAssembly, we can define complex, parametric models that are:
- **Portable**: Run anywhere with a WASM runtime.
- **Fast**: Near-native execution speed.
- **Composable**: Models can be transformed and combined using Operator modules that manipulate WASM bytecode.

## Project Structure

- `src/`: The host application (Orchestrator). Built with Rust, `wasmtime` for execution, and `egui` for the UI.
- `crates/models/`: Example model definitions (Sphere, Torus, Mandelbulb, etc.).
- `crates/operators/`: Modules that transform or combine models (Translate, Boolean Union/Subtract/Intersect).

## Architecture

The system is divided into three main components:

### 1. Model WASM Modules
A Model module is a WASM artifact that exports:
- `is_inside(x: f64, y: f64, z: f64) -> f32`: Returns a density value (current demo models output `1.0` for inside and `0.0` for outside; future models may use continuous densities).
- `get_bounds_min_x/y/z() -> f64` & `get_bounds_max_x/y/z() -> f64`: Defines the axis-aligned bounding box.

### 2. Operator WASM Modules
Operators are the "compilers" of the volumetric world. They take existing models or configurations as input and produce a new Model WASM as output. 

Operators export:
- `get_metadata() -> i64`: Returns a pointer/length to a CBOR-encoded `OperatorMetadata` struct, describing inputs (e.g., Model WASM, CDDL-schema-defined configurations).
- `run()`: The execution entry point where it pulls inputs via host imports and pushes results.

### 3. The Orchestrator (Host)
The host application manages the lifecycle of models and operators:
- **Project DAG**: Manages a sequence of operations to build complex scenes.
- **Rendering**: Implements both Point Cloud sampling and Marching Cubes (CPU-based) to visualize the WASM-defined volumes.
- **Bytecode Manipulation**: Orchestrates the execution of Operators to generate new model bytecode on the fly.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You need the Rust toolchain and the WASM target:
```bash
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

### Building

Build the host application:
```bash
cargo build --release
```

Build all WASM demo models and operators:
```bash
cargo build-wasm
```
*(This uses a Cargo alias defined in `.cargo/config.toml`)*

### Running

```bash
cargo run --release
```

In the UI:
1.  **Demos**: Load pre-built models from the "Demo" panel.
2.  **Operations**: Apply operators like "Translate" or "Boolean" to transform your models.
3.  **Visualization**: Toggle between Point Cloud and Marching Cubes rendering modes.

## Performance Note

While sampling a function via WASM for every voxel in a grid is computationally intensive, this project demonstrates that with efficient runtimes (like `wasmtime`) and optimized sampling strategies, it is a highly viable approach for flexible 3D modeling.
